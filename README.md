## Data Sources

- **Water Service Line Inventory**: City of Chicago water service line inventory data
- **Geocoded Addresses**: Chicago address points with geographic coordinates
- **Census Data**: American Community Survey (ACS) demographic data for Chicago census tracts

## Lead Status Categories

The map displays water service lines in four categories:

- üî¥ **Lead (L)**: Confirmed lead service line
- üü† **Galvanized Requiring Replacement (GRR)**: Galvanized pipes that need replacement
- üü° **Unknown (U)**: Service line material is unknown
- üü¢ **Non-Lead (NL)**: Confirmed non-lead service line

## Choropleth Map Layers

The map supports census tract visualization with three demographic overlays:

- **Percent Requires Replacement**: Percentage of addresses requiring lead pipe replacement
- **Percent Poverty**: Poverty rate percentage by census tract
- **Percent Minority**: Minority population percentage by census tract

These overlays use quantile-based color scales calculated from the census data. The quantile breakpoints are automatically generated when processing data.

## Embedding the Map

The map can be embedded in other websites using an `iframe`. Here's an example:

```html
<iframe
	src="https://grist.org/project/chi-water-service-lines/"
	style="margin-left: calc(50% - 50vw); width: 100vw; height: calc(100vh - 66px); border: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;"
></iframe>
```

## Search Details

### Indexing Strategy

The application uses a custom-built minimal search index optimized for fast address lookups:

1. **Index Generation** (`scripts/src/generate-minimal-search-index.ts`):
   - Processes 470,000+ Chicago addresses from CSV data
   - Creates a normalized street name index for efficient searching
   - Handles special cases like intersection addresses (e.g., "W LAKE & N CALIF")
   - Applies some normalization (e.g., "Martin Luther King Jr" ‚Üí "King")
   - Compresses the index using Brotli compression (120MB -> 12MB)

2. **Index Structure**:
   - `streetNames`: Maps normalized street words to address IDs
   - `addresses`: Array of minimal address objects with coordinates
   - Intersection addresses are indexed by each street component separately

### Search Strategy

The client-side search (`src/lib/components/search/SearchPanel.svelte`) implements:

1. **Query Processing**:
   - Normalizes user input (handles abbreviations, directions, common variants)
   - Supports multiple search patterns:
     - Number + street: "123 Main St"
     - Street only: "Michigan Ave"
     - Intersections: "Lake & California" or "Lake and California"

2. **Intersection Search**:
   - Detects intersection queries (contains "&" or "and")
   - Finds addresses matching ALL streets in the intersection
   - Works regardless of street order (e.g., "Lake & Calif" = "Calif & Lake")

3. **Efficiency Optimizations**:
   - Uses pre-built street index instead of scanning all addresses
   - Limits results to top 5 matches
   - Debounces search queries (300ms delay)

### Serverless Function

The inventory lookup API (`functions/packages/inventory/lookup-v2/index.js`) provides:

1. **Purpose**: Fetches detailed water service line data for specific addresses
2. **Architecture**:
   - Deployed as a Digital Ocean serverless function
   - Uses pre-indexed, address-based lookup stored as compressed Brotli JSON
   - Caches lookup data in memory for performance
   - Returns all service lines at a given address (some addresses have multiple)

3. **Data Flow**:
   - Client searches for address ‚Üí gets full address string from search index
   - Client calls serverless function with address parameter
   - Function returns inventory data including:
     - Lead status (L, GRR, U, NL)
     - Material details for public/private lines and gooseneck
     - High risk property indicators
   - Client updates map marker color based on worst lead status

This architecture separates search (client-side) from inventory data (server-side) to optimize initial load times while providing detailed data on demand. The v2 API supports multiple service lines per address, which is common in multi-unit buildings.
